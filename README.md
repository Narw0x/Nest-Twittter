Navigate to FE / BE directories and install dependencies in both:

``` npm install ```

Check the `.env.example` file in  BE directory and create `.env` file based on it, filling in the necessary values.
For the backend, you will need to set up a MongoDB database and provide the connection string in the `.env` file.

Start the backend server:

``` npm run start:dev ```

Start the frontend server:

``` npm run dev ```
